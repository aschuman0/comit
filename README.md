# Comit - A max patch without an acronym.

_This will be an ongoing and evolving project._

## Current requirements:
- Monome 64
## Probable future requirements:
- Touchscreen device capable of running touchOSC (iOS or Android Tablet)

## Things currently on the roadmap:
- MLR like slicing, mapped along rows of monome 64
- Live audio input and recording
- Buffer live recording and playback
- VST and AU effect support
- Raw data outputs (button presses, extracts from audio) for use in other patches (see video repo)

### TODO:
- Get monome input
- Play from buff
- Slice from Buff
