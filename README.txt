Comit - A max patch without an acronym.

This will be an ongoing and evolving project.

Things currently on the roadmap:
MLR like slicing, mapped along rows of monome 64
Live audio input and recording
Buffer live recording and playback
VST and AU effect support
Raw data outputs (button presses, extracts from audio) for use in other patches (see video repo)

TODO:
Get monome input
Play from buff
Slice from Buff
